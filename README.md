# Multithreading Pathing Pool
### NOTE: This was an assignment for Champlain College so a starting codebase was given to students. Most of the student work was done in the PathingPool and GameApp files.
Utilizes multithreading to queue pathfinding requests (A* or Dijkstra) and displays requests received and requests processed per second. It is meant to showcase that using more threads will compute pathingfinding requests faster. Increase/decrease number of threads being used by pressing comma/period. Switch between Dijkstra and A* using the D/A keys.
